[Brian Lonsdorf](https://github.com/DrBoolean) - thank you, Brian! A fundamental assumption of each tutorial is that you've watched his [video](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-composable-error-handling-with-either) before tackling the equivalent PureScript abstraction featured in this tutorial.  Brian covers the featured concepts extremely well, and I feel it's better that you understand its implementation in the comfort of JavaScript. Finally, if you read something that you feel could be explained better, or a code example that needs refactoring, then please let me know via a comment or send me a pull request on [Github](https://github.com/adkelley/javascript-to-purescript/tree/master/tut04P1).

## Introduction

In [Part 1](https://github.com/adkelley/javascript-to-purescript/tree/master/tut04P1), recall that a function or expression creates a side effect whenever it modifies some state outside its scope, or it has an observable interaction with the outside world.  We don't eliminate them because side effects help us to write useful code.  Instead, we represent them explicitly in the type system to distinguish them from pure computations.  One benefit is that future maintainers will recognize that there are side effects in our code more readily.

There is a particular class produced by the runtime system, called a 'native' side effect. Console IO, random number generation, and file IO are examples of native side effects.  I covered console IO and random number generation in Part 1; now we'll learn file IO in PureScript in this tutorial.  But there's more - I'm going to sync back up with Brian’s [tutorial](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-composable-error-handling-with-either) by showing how `chain` can be used to compose nested `Either`s together in PureScript.

## Can you spot the side effects in JavaScript?

When I’m reviewing code, sometimes I feel like I’m reading [“Where’s Wally?”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where%27s_Wally%3F), searching for side effects and confirming their types. All kidding aside, take a look at the try/catch example below and see if you can name the side effects it generates. Since this is going to serve as our imperative example, let’s quickly review what it does. A `try` will test a block of code for errors, and the accompanying `catch` block will handle those errors. Using `readFileSync` from Node.js, this example reads and returns a port number from the configuration file `config.js`. If all goes well, the try block will return the port number. But if `readFileSync` or `JSON.parse` fails, then the `catch` block will return a default port number of 3000.

```JavaScript
const fs = require('fs')

const getPort = () => {
  try {
    const str = fs.readFileSync('config.json')
    const config = JSON.parse(str)
    return config.port
  } catch(e) {
    return 3000
  }
}

const result = getPort()
console.log(result)
```

Besides the methods themselves, notice there is nothing explicit in JavaScript to tell maintainers that there are two or possibly three side-effects — console IO, file IO and, if something goes wrong, an exception. Now you may be entirely comfortable with that, and it is not your fault because there is no type system in JavaScript. But on bigger JavaScript projects, I usually create a comment to declare my side effects, and I try to confine them to the outer edges of my code.

## File IO in PureScript

Before tackling nested either constructors with `chain`, let's learn how to read a file in PureScript using the `Node.FS` modules from the `purescript-node-fs` package.  Again, file IO is a native side effect and, as I showed in Part 1, we use the Eff Monad to wrap them.  Don't worry if you have not encountered monads yet.  I think it is better to learn monads by showing concrete examples first to develop an intuition about how they work.  Later on, you should go to the literature to get a more formal appreciation.  But be careful, there are many monad tutorials that just get it absolutely wrong!  So let me help you to steer clear of them by recommending one of my [favorites](http://adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html#monads).

In the code example below, we have our usual import suspects such as `Prelude`.  But I have also added some new ones to support reading the `config.json` file. You can check them out in [pursuit](https://pursuit.purescript.org).  PureScript's type system makes it explicit about the side effects we generate.  Thus, in the `main` function, the effect monad `Eff` wraps and declares the following effects.  The file system `FS` effect comes from reading the text file, and the `CONSOLE` effect is for logging the `Either` constructor from `(try $ readTextFile)` to the console.  Finally, if something goes wrong, then raise an exception with the `EXCEPTION` effect.

```haskell
module Main where

import Prelude
import Effect (Effect)
import Effect.Console (CONSOLE, logShow)
import Effect.Exception (EXCEPTION, try)
import Node.Encoding (Encoding(..))
import Node.FS (FS)
import Node.FS.Sync (readTextFile)

pathToFile :: String
pathToFile = "./resources/config.json"

main :: forall e. Eff (fs :: FS, console :: CONSOLE, exception :: EXCEPTION | e) Unit
main =
  (try $ readTextFile UTF8 pathToFile) >>= logShow
```

Using the PureScript [REPL](http://www.purescript.org/learn/getting-started/) or directly from your [editor](https://github.com/purescript/purescript/wiki/Editor-and-tool-support), you can query the type declaration to find that `(try $ readTextFile)` returns `Eff FS (Right String)` on success or `Eff EXCEPTION (Left Error)` when there is an exception.  On account of the side effect created from `readTextFile`, the Eff monad is needed to wrap the `FS` or `EXCEPTION` effect together with the `Either` constructor.

Now don't gloss over that inconspicuous bind operator `(>>=)` connecting `(try $ readTextFile)` to `logShow`, because you will encounter bind often in PureScript and other FP languages.  We use it to take a construct out of a monad, to enable function application on that value or object.  In our example, `bind` takes the `Either Error String` out of the Eff monad to allow logging to the console using `logShow`. If `readTextFile` is successful then `(Right "{\"port\": 8888}\n")` is logged, otherwise you will see `(Left Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, . . .)`. Finally, `main` will terminate by returning `Unit` (i.e., nothing), signifying that the program terminated correctly.


## Using chain to compose nested Either constructors

We are ready to handle the potential for nested `Either` constructors stemming from multiple error tests.  More intuitively, if we don’t handle it upfront, after conducting a second error test we end up with a `Right` of a `Left` of some error, or we have a `Right` of another `Right`.  Unwrapping multiple inner values is problematic, so it is best to manage it as we go along.  In the case of nested Either constructors, we use the `chain` function.  Think of it like `map` from my previous tutorials, except `chain` un-nests the resulting nested object and wraps it back up the way we want it.  Here is the type definition:

`chain :: forall a b e. (a -> Either e b) ->  Either e a -> Either e b`

The first argument to `chain` is an error test function that takes a polymorphic type and maps it to a `Left e` or `Right b` where `e` is some polymorphic error type, and `b` is another polymorphic type. Note we make the type declarations in `chain` polymorphic to handle `Either` constructors with different types at different times.  Our second argument is a `Right a` or `Left e`, computed from the last error test function before calling `chain`.  And finally, after executing the exception handler (i.e., the first argument), we output a `Left e` or `Right b`, depending on an error or success.

### Records

With the intuition for `chain` under our belt, let's look at the final PureScript code example below.  Skipping the import declarations, the first new piece of syntax is `newtype Port = Port { port :: Int }`.  This newtype `Port` has an underlying Object type, which is an essential building block in PureScript that mimics JavaScript objects. This fact makes it my choice for representing our JSON string `{"port": 8888}` in `config.json`.  The `{ ... }` is just syntactic sugar for the Object type constructor `Object ( port  :: Int )`, which takes a row of types to a type.  You can read more about records in [Purescript by Example](https://leanpub.com/purescript/read#leanpub-auto-functions-and-records).  Also,  see [Tutorial 1](https://github.com/adkelley/javascript-to-purescript/tree/master/tut01) for another example of a `newtype` and its class instances.

On the next line, we create a class instance of `show` for `Port`, which declares how to log the port number to the console. Next up is our `defaultPort`, for cases where there's an exception during one of the error tests.  Then comes `parsePort`, which has the responsibility of parsing the JSON string from `config.json` to our port object.  There's a lot to unpack in this function, so check to ensure you have a full cup of coffee or tea before proceeding.

```Haskell
module Main where

import Prelude
import Effect (Eff)
import Effect.Console (log, logShow)
import Effect.Exception (Error, error, try)
import Control.Monad.Except (runExcept)
import Data.Either (Either(..), either)
import Data.Foreign (unsafeFromForeign)
import Data.Foreign.JSON (parseJSON)
import Node.Encoding (Encoding(..))
import Node.FS (FS)
import Node.FS.Sync (readTextFile)
import Data.List.NonEmpty (head)

pathToFile :: String
pathToFile = "./resources/config.json"

newtype Port = Port { port :: Int }
instance showPort :: Show Port where
  show (Port { port }) = show port

defaultPort :: Port
defaultPort = Port { port: 3000 }

parsePort :: String -> Either Error Port
parsePort port =
  case parsed of
    Left nel -> Left $ error $ show $ head nel
    Right x -> Right (unsafeFromForeign x :: Port)
  where parsed = runExcept $ parseJSON port

chain :: forall a b e. (a -> Either e b) ->  Either e a -> Either e b
chain f  = either (\e -> Left e) (\x -> (f x))

getPort :: Effect Port
getPort =
  (try $ readTextFile UTF8 pathToFile) >>=
  chain parsePort >>>
  either (\_ -> defaultPort) id >>>
  pure

main :: Effect Unit
main =
  logShow =<< getPort
```  

### parsePort

The function `parseJSON` is equivalent to `JSON.parse()` in JavaScript.  It returns a value or object described by the string or a syntax error in case of an exception.  To get the object returned from `parseJSON` into an Either constructor, we use `runExcept`.  Then, wrap the return object in a `Right` with a value of type `Foreign`.  Or, in case there is an exception, wrap the syntax error in a `Left (NonEmptyList ForeignError)`.  Now, let's go over these new types, `Foreign` and `NonEmptyList ForeignError`.

#### Foreign and ForeignError

To better understand what sort of data you are handling, the creators of PureScript have made types & effects more granular than most other FP languages.  Using our current code example, when we attempt to parse the JSON string from `config.json`, there is no guarantee that the object will be in the correct form.  PureScript exposes this fact in the type system with the type, `Foreign`.  This type denotes a JSON response or a value returned from JavaScript code.

Now what about (NonEmptyList ForeignError)?  Well, I hope you see that familiar theme I mentioned related to granularity.  The type `ForeignError` denotes foreign type errors stemming from a JSON response or a value returned from Javascript code.  So like `Foreign`, they are exposed directly within the type system, and because there can be multiple errors generated by an exception handler, we collect them in a nonempty list.

With `Foreign` and `ForeignError` out of the way, let's finish up `parsePort`. After parsing the JSON string, when the result is a syntax error then take the `ForeignError` from the head of the nonempty list `nel`, convert it to a string, and wrap the JavaScript error in `Left`.  If parseJSON is successful, then coerce the object into a `Port` type, with the help of `(unsafeFromForeign x :: Port)`, and then wrap it in `Right`.  And finally we come to `getPort`.  

### getPort

First, notice the return type signature:

`Effect Port`

It makes it very clear that `getPort` creates side effects along with the return type.  Once again, we see `(try $ readTextFile)` which will return an `Effect (Right String)` or, in the case of an exception, `Effect (Left Error)`.  Then, use the bind operator `>>=` to take the Either construct out of the `Eff` monad, which becomes our second argument in `chain`.  After executing `chain`, we compose the result with `either` to deliver a port number. Finally,  wrap the result back in the `Eff` monad with `pure` before returning.


## Final Points

In my [github repository](https://github.com/adkelley/javascript-to-purescript/tree/master/tut04P2), I've created two versions of `getPort` - one that ignores any errors and returns `Port`, and the other returns `Either Error Port`.  You can play around with the latter by creating JSON or read file errors and view them in the console.  Also, I've added another exception handler to illustrate how to compose multiple `chain` functions together.

That’s all for now. Be sure to leave a comment if you have any questions. In the next tutorial, I’m going to show more Either examples in PureScript that have been converted from imperative JavaScript. So stay tuned!

But if you're an eager beaver and would like to look ahead, then most the of code samples from Brian's [videos](https://egghead.io/courses/professor-frisby-introduces-composable-functional-javascript) have been ported to PureScript already. But I may amend them as I write the accompanying tutorial markdown.
