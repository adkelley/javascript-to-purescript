Welcome to Tutorial 15 in the series **Make the leap from Javascript to PureScript**.  I hope you're enjoying it thus far.  If you're new to this series, then be sure to read the [Introduction](https://github.com/adkelley/javascript-to-purescript) to learn how to install and run PureScript.

In this tutorial, we're going to examine the `pure` function applied to a few types we covered in the past.  In some respect, you can think of the function `pure` as the equivalent of JavaScript's `of` function. In JavaScript, a *pointed functor* is a functor with an `of` method.  However, you'll likely never hear someone within the PureScript community refer to a Pointed Functor because there is no type class for it.  More on this later.

I borrowed (with permission) the outline and javascript code samples from the egghead.io course [Professor Frisby Introduces Composable Functional JavaScript](https://egghead.io/courses/professor-frisby-introduces-composable-functional-javascript) by
[Brian Lonsdorf](https://github.com/DrBoolean) - thank you, Brian! A fundamental assumption is that you have watched his [video](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-lifting-into-a-pointed-functor) before tackling the equivalent PureScript abstraction featured in this tutorial.  Brian covers the featured concepts exceptionally well, and it's better you understand its implementation in the comfort of JavaScript.

## Lifting into a Functor
In past code examples, we often took a concrete value or expression `a` and applied a type constructor `f` to get an `f a`.   We did this using type constructors such as `Box`, `Either`, `Maybe`, and `Task`.  What I didn't mention is the name of this process, which is called `lifting`. The intuition for lifting is that we are embedding the `a` in some broader context that is characterized by the type constructor.   

For example, when we embed a value in the `Either a b` type constructor, we are putting it into a context characterized by a `Left a` or `Right b` type constructor.  By convention, `Right b` is used to represent a value or expression that is correct.  While `Left a`  often means that something went wrong in our computation.  This convention implies that we have a contract with the compiler.  I like to think of this contract as a statement that says - "whenever you see a `Right b`, then continue to map or compose my functions in sequence (i.e., bind) on `b` until the final result OR until you encounter a `Left a`".  "If you encounter a `Left a`, then stop any further mapping or binding and return `Left a` to me so that I can examine and deal with it."

In JavaScript, we lift a value into a Pointed Functor using the `of` function.  For example, we know from the last tutorial that Arrays are functors because they have a map operation.  Therefore, in JavaScript, `of = x ⇒ [x] ` lifts `x` into the pointed functor `Array`.  In PureScript, I can lift a value into a functor by merely applying the type constructor to the value.  For example, let's have another look at the function `moneyToFloat` from [Tutorial2]().  It has been slightly modified to check whether the number is `NaN` :
```haskell
nanToMaybe :: Number → Maybe Number
nanToMaybe x =
  if (isNaN x)
    then Nothing
    else Just x

moneyToFloat :: String -> Box (Maybe Number)
moneyToFloat str =
  Box str 
  #  map (replace (Pattern "$") (Replacement "")) 
  #  map (\replaced -> nanToMaybe $ unsafeParseFloat replaced)
```
I can apply `Box str` directly because the function's type signature implies lifting `str` into `Box`.  For a moment, imagine that we change the type signature to `moneyToFloat ::  String → Maybe Number`.  How can I ensure my code runs without having to replace `Box str` with `Just str` explicitly?  And what about other type constructors in the future? For example, I may later decide to change it to `moneyToFloat ::  String → Either a Number` so that I can report the error.  I sure don't want to look for and change all the constructors explicitly. Instead, whenever I refactor my code, I would prefer something a little more future proof.

Fortunately, there is a function in PureScript that applies the correct context based on a functor's characteristics, and it's called `pure`.  If you're coming from JavaScript, then feel free to think of `pure` as the equivalent to the function,`of` in JavaScript.    Now let's rewrite `moneyToFloat` in the `Maybe` context using `pure`.  This way, I use `join` and later `fromMaybe` to flatten the two Maybe constructors.  Then, I console log either the actual number or, in case there is an error, `0.0`. 

```haskell
nanToMaybe :: Number → Maybe Number
nanToMaybe x =
  if (isNaN x)
    then Nothing
    else pure x

moneyToFloat ::  String → Maybe Number
moneyToFloat str =
  pure str
  # map (replace (Pattern "$") (Replacement "")
  # map (\replaced → nanToMaybe $ unsafeParseFloat replaced)
  # join
 
main =
  logShow $ fromMaybe 0.0 $ moneyToFloat "$1.55"
  logShow $ fromMaybe 0.0 $ moneyToFloat "$NaN"
```
Now let's look at some code examples that use `pure`  to lift a value into the proper context based on a Functor's characteristics.

## Hello Either
```haskell
-- | either.of(x) == pure x
-- | returns Right "hello"
eitherHello :: Either String String
eitherHello = pure "hello"

main = logShow $ map (_ <> "!") eitherHello
```
We use the function `pure` to lift our value `hello` into `Right "hello"`.   Then, in `main`, we map over the functor by lifting the expression `(_ <> "!")` into the `Either` context.  Since `eitherHello` returns `Right "hello"`, we can successfully map the expression `(_ <> "!")`  on "hello"; logging `Right "hello!"` to the console.  

## Hello Task
The constructor `TaskE` is a little more interesting:
```haskell
-- | task.of("hello") == taskOf "hello" == pure "hello"
-- | returns (TaskE a "hello") where a is a String
taskHello :: TaskE String String
taskHello = taskOf "hello"

-- | returns (TaskE "noHello" b), where b is a String
-- | taskRejected == throwError
taskNoHello :: TaskE String String
taskNoHello = taskRejected "noHello for you"

showTask :: TaskE String String → Task Unit
showTask =
  fork (\e → log $ "err " <> e) (\y → log $ "success " <> y)

main = do
  void $ launchAff $ showTask taskHello
  void $ launchAff $ showTask taskNoHello
```
If you squint hard enough, `TaskE a b`  starts to look and behave like the `Either a b` constructor, with errors placed in the `a` slot, and successful computations placed in the `b` slot.  In fact, underneath the covers, `TaskE` is ultimately transformed to the  `Either` type constructor.  Its type signature is: `type TaskE x a = ExceptT x Aff a`.  Here, `ExceptT` is a monad transformer that allows us to combine multiple monads to form a new monad.  Yes, I know we haven't covered monads, and we'll finally cover them in detail in the next tutorial.  In the meantime, it is enough to know that the function `runExceptT :: forall e m a. ExceptT e m a -> m (Either e a) ` is used to transform our `TaskE` down to a `Task (Left e)` or `Task (Right a)`.

## Where's my Pointed Functor type class?
Throughout this tutorial, I've been careful not to say that the function `pure`  lifts a value or an expression into a Pointed Functor.  I did this because there is no Pointed Functor type class in PureScript.  In fact, within the FP community, the `Pointed Functor` has lost its luster because it doesn't add any new laws to Functor. Moreover there is nothing to specify the meaning of `Pointed` or its relationship to `map`.  I believe the author of PureScript recognized this and thereby avoided the mistake made in older FP languages, such as Haskell, by creating a type class for Pointed Functor and later [regretting it](https://wiki.haskell.org/Why_not_Pointed%3F). 

At this point, you should be asking, "if there's no Pointed Functor type class then where does `pure` appear?".  You'll find it in the [Control.Applicative](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-prelude/4.0.1/docs/Control.Applicative#v:pure) module, which adds support for applicative functors.  We haven't covered applicative functors yet, but we will be soon.  For now, it suffices to say that like monads (covered in the next tutorial) they are functors with extra laws and operations.
 
## Summary
In this tutorial, I showed how to lift a value or expression `a` into a functor `f` by using the function `pure`.  For example, `Box a = pure a`.  While you can also apply a functor to a value directly  (e.g., `Box a`),  this approach isn't as future proof as using `pure` .  For example, if I decide to change a setter's type signature from `Box a`  to `Maybe a`, using `pure` ensures that my `a` is lifted into the `Maybe` functor automatically without explicitly applying `Just a` in my code.

That's all for now. My next tutorial we finally explore the infamous topic of monads and we'll look a little further into `bind` and see laws that ensure the monadic structure works correctly.
